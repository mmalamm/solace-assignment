In my application, in the search form, I want to enable the user to enter a search term, where the user should be able to search by name or city.
I also want to allow the user to choose specialties from a list to filter advocates who have those specialties
I also want to allow them to choose from one of the degrees, PhD MD or MSW
I also want them to be able to filter by x+ years of experience

I want the results to be paginated sensibly to allow the user to choose between 10, 25, or 100 results per page

is the database set up correctly in order to do this? how would I have to modify the src/app/api/advocates/route.ts to accommadate the form submission action? can you explain and outline the solution for me before you do anything? and write the explanation and steps as a markdown file
